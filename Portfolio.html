       <pre><h3> <article><ul><li> I'm a web developer and a BCA student. I love creating websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a passion for web design and development, and 
 I enjoy learning new things and solving problems.</li></ul>

 <ul><li>Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. Iâ€™m currently taking online courses on Youtube and websites to expand my web development toolkit. 
Iâ€™m also interested in full-stack development.</li></ul></h3>
<p>


    As a budding web designer and developer, I'm passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. My journey began with learning the fundamentals of HTML, 
    CSS, and JavaScript. I've dabbled in responsive design, exploring how websites adapt seamlessly across devices. Whether it's crafting elegant layouts, optimizing performance, or experimenting
    with cutting-edge technologies, I'm committed to continuous learning and growth. Let's build something remarkable together!
    Embarking on my web design and development journey has 
    been exhilarating. Armed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I've crafted my first web pagesâ€”each line of code a step toward realizing my vision. Responsive design has become my playground, as I
    explore media queries and flexible grids to ensure seamless experiences on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I've delved into front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and React, discovering
    their power in streamlining development. But it's not just about pixels and syntax; it's about understanding users, solving problems, and creating delightful interfaces. As I venture deeper
    into the world of APIs, databases, and back-end technologies,
    I'm fueled by curiosity and the desire to build meaningful digital solutions. Let's collaborate and turn ideas into captivating web realities! ðŸš€</p>
